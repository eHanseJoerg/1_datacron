    "\n",
    "In the last notebok (5.3) we made some basic analysis on the available wx and other parameters. Deriving from these insights, we could conclude that we are 1) dealing with an imbalanced problem, and 2) some wx parameters did not play a role for our subset of data from April 2016  for seasonal reasons (e.g. no storm data available). \n",
    "\n",
    "## a) Dealing with an imbalanced problem: Defining Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In many applications (e.g. fraud detection), the minority class contains the more important or costly events. The same applies to our problem, as has been commented by CRIDA in our interview. Therefore, the estimator should have the tendency to capture as many of the critical entries as possible, even at the cost of misclassifying uncritical entries. The simple accuracy metric is not sufficient for these types of problems, because if, like in our case, the problem is imbalanced so that 94% of the entries belong to one class, a completely naive classifier that would just classify all items as belonging to the majority class, would acheive an accuracy of 94%, but would classify 100% of the minority entries wrong.   The following  definitions adapted from [Fawcett, T: An introduction to ROC analysis](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.200) help to formalize the problem and select the correct scoring methods. The confusion matrix allows us to define different metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/confusion_matrix_1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a regulated event as belonging to the \"positive class\", the label encoded as 1 in the dataset, and a non-regulated event as belonging to the \"negative class\" with the label 0. Considering the reply from CRIDA, it is critical to catch as much of the regulated events as possible, even at the cost of having some false positives in the result set. Lets define this more exactly. Let $m$ be the total of observations. Let\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    " \\begin{align}\n",
    "accuracy &= \\frac{TP + TN}{m} \\\\\n",
    "tp \\ rate \\ (recall) &= \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} \\\\\n",
    "fp \\ rate &= \\frac{FP}{FP + TN} \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    " $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now state that for our purposes, the $tp \\ rate$ should be optimized, even at the expense of collecting some false positives. The classifiers will internally compute a class probability between 0 and 1 for each predicted outcome. For example, a certain dataset might be classified as \"0.85 probability of being not regulated\". By shifting the classification threshold away from 0.5, we can adjust the number of events that are classified as \"positive\", with the tradeoff of increasing ambiguity. If we plot $tp \\ rate$ against $fp \\ rate$ on a chart for each probability threshold, we get the so-called ROC-curve:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/roccurve.png\" width=30%,height=30%>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the ML process is to attain a high $tp \\ rate$ and a low $fp \\ rate$. Therefore, the more prononced the bend of the curve away from the luck line $f(x) = x$ is, the better the classifier. This \"bending\" can also be measured by the metric $AUC$, which stands for \"area under the curve\" and is literally the area under the ROC curve, the graph being normalized to having a total area of 1. An AUC of .5 would mean that there is no difference to guessing, and an AUC of 1 would represent the ideal classifier. The problem is _learnable_ if a definitive bend away from the luck line can be observed. We are dealing with an imbalanced dataset. To gain an initial understanding, we calculate a baseline first. This baseline represents the performance that would be acheived by a primitive classifier that classifies all entries as belonging to the majority class. \n",

    "## c) Dealing with non-relevant features\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset contains only April 2016. As the Iberian peninsula is subject to seasonal climate changes, we do not have all possible weather conditions in our sample dataset. For example, we do not have storm conditions or freezing precipitation in our dataset. An experiment on a larger data basis should consider these variables, for our purpos here, we will omit them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## d) Other considerations (preprocessing, hyperparameters, cross validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of machine learning methods often used to be a lucky guess on which algorithms and parameters to choose. But the scikit-learn API makes it very easy to apply advanced learning methods to our model. We can perform a Grid Search on the hyperparameters so that the best hyperparameters are found for us. It is easy to implement cross-validation into the learning process. The following advanced techniques will be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Normalization\n",
    "Feature normalization has the purpose of leveling different features into a comparable numerical dimension. While _scaling_ only levels the numerical range of the features, _normalization_ refers to a transformation that generates an input matrix where the features have 0 mean and equal variance across the observations. We will be using `sklearn` for this purpose. In `sklearn`, two different classes implement scaling and normalization, respectively: `MinMaxScaler` and `StandardScaler`. As described in the `sklearn` documentation, scaling is more common to preprocess data for Neural Nets, while normalization is being used for Support Vector Machines and alike. It should be noted that the scaling/normalization process (data transformation) should be learned from the training set, and only _applied_ to the test set. But because we are using k-fold cross validation, we would introduce errors if we would renormalize in each  fold. Therefore, the sklearn documentation advises to embed the normalization process into a `pipeline` which is an sklearn class that chains estimators together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia: Cross Validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)): \"Cross-validation, sometimes called rotation estimation, is a model validation technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set.\" Cross-validation allows us to divide the training set into a training and validation set, but still learn from the complete set by performing the division several times, each time differently:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/K-fold_cross_validation_EN.jpg\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pipelining\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelining is a method offered by scikit-learn that allows to bundle several data transformation steps together, with one final estimator class doing the classification/regression. This allows to call .fit() only once on the complete pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Having constructed a classifier with the transformation/estimation pipeline, Grid Search allows us to train the classifier iteratively, each time with slightly different hyperparemeters. At the end, Grid Search will terminate with the estimators tuned to the best parameters found during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Oversampling for imbalanced Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "lorem ipsum\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the correct analysis, different algorithmic methods are available to deal with imbalanced problems. Some examples are oversampling and undersampling. We are going to use a vanilla and an oversampled dataset to compare the results of the oversampling method. Oversampling works as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "A support vector machine (SVM) is an algorithm that learns by fitting a hyperplane into the problem space such that this hyperplane seperates the two target classes as clearly as possible. Because it might not be possible to find such a plane, two measures are introduced:\n",
    " - an error function is introduced which is more than 0 if a specific data point is on the wrong side of the margin. The algorithm will try to minimize this margin.\n",
    " - the data might not be linearly separable in the dimensionality of the problem space. The algorithm will then project the problem into a higher-dimension space such that it becomes linearly separable. This is called Kernal trick.\n"

SMOTE is a tachnique with which the original data is enriched by artificial data points belonging to the minority class. These points are placed into the input space neighbouring the original data points such that the boundary that is separating the two classes is sharpened.\n",
